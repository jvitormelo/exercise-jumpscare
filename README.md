A desktop terrorist that randomly interrupts your day to make you do push-ups.

bun install
bun run start
# forget about it, get jumpscared in 20-40 min, do exercise, repeat
# Ctrl+C to stop
```

## Config

Edit `src/config.ts` to change intervals. Edit `src/exercises.ts` to change exercises.

Drop `sounds/alert.wav` for a custom jumpscare sound. May I suggest an air horn.
